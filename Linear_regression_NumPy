Trying to make use of multidimensional arrays:
The main difficulty with lists on Python is its total reluctance to be transformed numerically in anyway. Heres an example:

xvals = [1,2,3]
y = 2*xvals

For a fantastic reason that I have yet to grasp - Python will not do it like this. This is why arrays are so useful; 


P.S, If you would like to use this (i dont quite know why you would) data is best fed through as x first column, y second, x error 3rd and y error 4th.
error analysis coming soon to theatres near you!


import numpy as np
import scipy as scp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


def genfromtxt(file):
    array_file = np.genfromtxt(file,delimiter='\t') # the delimiter can be whatever you like - but tab is most appropriate.
    x = array_file[:,0] # this reads from the zeroth data file on the zeroth column to the last data file on the zeroth column. I still struggle with this concept but I'm definitely improving.
    y = array_file[:,1]
    xerr = array_file[:,2]
    yerr = array_file[:,3]
    
    return(x,y,xerr,yerr)
    
    
array = genfromtxt('LargeDataSet.txt') 

def calc(array):
    x = array[0]
    y = array[1]
    xerr = array[2]
    yerr = array[3]
    plt.plot(x,y)
    p1 = scp.polyfit(x,y,1)
    plt.plot(x,scp.polyval(p1,x))
    


calc(array)
